Azure DevOps pipeline for your OpenAI Platform with Kong. I've organized it into four stages:

1- Validate Stage: Initializes Terraform, validates your configuration, and creates a plan
2- Deploy Stage: Applies the Terraform plan to deploy your infrastructure
3- Verify Stage: Confirms your infrastructure is working correctly, including:

- Verifying Kong deployment and configuring test routes
- Checking OpenAI service and keys
- Verifying Databricks workspace status


4- DocumentOutputs Stage: Generates documentation with key information about your deployed resources

The pipeline includes comprehensive verification steps to ensure everything is working correctly after deployment. It also creates a detailed deployment summary document that's published as an artifact.
To use this pipeline, you'll need to:

1- Create an Azure DevOps service connection named 'Azure-Service-Connection' with permissions to your Azure subscription
2- Create an environment named 'Development' in Azure DevOps (under Pipelines > Environments)
3- Save this YAML file in your repository as 'azure-pipelines.yml'

- The pipeline will automatically trigger when changes are made to files in the terraform directory on the main branch.
